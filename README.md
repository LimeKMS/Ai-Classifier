# Ai-Classifier

Liam Rigney, Ricky Ledew

In order to run this program, you must have these files/folders in the same directory:
train.ipynb
test.ipynb
checkpoints folder
images folder

Due to size of the image folder, we decided not to include it into our submission, below is the link to the dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset

First, download the Version 1 of the dataset and extract the file, then place the images folder into the same directory
as the rest of the other file for this program.


If you are using a python notebook IDE, you just have to run the two files in this order:
train.ipynb
test.ipynb

If you are using a cmd prompt with jupyter:
just run these commands:

jupyter nbconvert --execute train.ipynb
jupyter nbconvert --execute test.ipynb

We suggest using a python notebook IDE as you will have increased functionality due to being able to choose to use checkpoints.
